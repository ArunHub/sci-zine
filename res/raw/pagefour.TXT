          2. IMMUNE SYSTEM

Health is Wealth is an apt proverb. There can be no wealth greater than the good health that a person enjoys. In a healthy state, a person keeps himself physically, mentally and socially, fit.  When a person is in good health, the different organ systems, not only function well discharging their duties, but the body as a whole is also able to adjust itself and strike a balance with the physical, mental and social environments.The varying environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, sun, rain, pollution caused by man, atomic radiation, malnutrition, the millions of microbes that surround our bodies, the inter-personal confl icts are all other factors affect our lives and are challenges to our health.
