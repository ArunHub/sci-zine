Genetic engineering is the modification of the genetic information of living organisms by manipulation of DNA by adding, removing or repairing part of genetic material and changing the phenotype of the organism. It is also known as gene manipulation or recombinant DNA Technology Recent advances made in Genetics, Molecular Biology and Bio-Chemistry have resulted in the origin of this new branch of science. Understanding of the gene structure and function through basic research. Production  of large quantities of insulin, interferon human growth hormones, proteins and vaccines for foot and mouth disease of cattle (komari in Tamil)This technique is also employed in the transfer of genes involved in Nitrogen fixation. This will help the cultivator to increase productivity. The enzymes which can cut DNA into fragments, and enzymes which can join such fragments.
