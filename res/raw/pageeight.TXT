The distal branches terminate as bulb like structures called synaptic knob filled with chemicals called neuro transmitters. Axon contains axoplasm inside and is covered by a membrane called neurilemma. Neurilemma en-closes the axon except at the branched distal ends. In some neurons called myelinated neurons an additional white fatty fibre called myelin sheath covers the neurilemma. Myelin sheath is not continuous over the neurilemma. The gaps left by the myelin sheath on the axon are called Nodes. Over the myelin sheath are found certain cells called Schwann cells.When the axon is enclosed by the white fatty myelin cover it is called Myelinated or Medullated or White neurons. This forms the white matter of our brain. It is the cell structure irregular in shape or polyhedral structure, it is also called as cyton. Cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies are called Nissle’s granules .
