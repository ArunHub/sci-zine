Evolution may be defined as a gradual development of more complex species from pre-existing simpler forms. It is an extremely slow process and has occurred over millions of years,as 
revealed by fossil evidences. When two populations are isolated by geographical barriers, or reproductive barriers, there is a chance for a change to develop in their gene flow leading to formation of a new species. Genetic drift with changes in the gene flow imposed by isolation mechanism acts as an agent of speciation.Thus speciation is arising of a new species from a sub-population of a species which is geographically or reproductively isolated over a long period of time from the other population of the same species.The next stage of human evolution came into existence 1.5 million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus who were meat eaters.
