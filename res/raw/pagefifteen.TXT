Extracellular digestion
As animal body becomes more complex, digestive system has evolved to digest the food taken into the body. Food is taken into alimentary canal and in the regions of digestion like mouth, stomach and duodenum, digestive juice is by the digestive glands and the complex food swallowed is broken down to simpler food molecules by the action of enzymes of the digestive juices. Since digestion takes place in the space or lumen of alimentary canal i.e outside the cell it is called as extracellular digestion an advanced form of digestion.Digestion in human beingsFood contains a number of nutrient molecules needed for building up of new body tissues, repairing damaged tissues and sustained reactions.
