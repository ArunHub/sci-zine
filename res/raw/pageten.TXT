          4. REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

Do you know that all living organisms reproduce (both plants and animals)? 
Reproduction is a special biological process, by which new individuals of the same species are produced. It is one of the biological processes like nutrition, respiration and excretion etc.
Modes of reproduction in single cell organism 
Let us examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The methods by which organisms reproduce depend upon the body shape and structure of organisms.Unicellular like amoeba and bacteria, split into two equal halves and produce new ones which is called binary fission.Some Bacteria, like Lactobacilli, Salmonella multiply rapidly, others like Myco bacterium tuberculosis, 
multiply slowly.
