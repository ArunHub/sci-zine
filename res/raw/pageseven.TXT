           3.HUMAN BODY-ORGAN SYTEMS

Two or more people when gather to-gether, each one is set with an interest and aptitude and performs his works in his own way. But when it is the question of maintenance of an order, a systematic working among them, there is a need for someone to control and co-ordinate them 
so that a harmony prevails. Similarly the functions of organs and organ system in our body cannot go on in their own way but must be coordinated to maintain the harmonius steady state of body function-ing called Homeostasis. In our body the neural or nervous system and the endo-crine system do the function of coordinat-ing and integrating all the activities of the organs so that the body works efficiently by synchronizing the functions.
