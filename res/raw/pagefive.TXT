Healthy body maintains a constant blood sugar level which is normally 80-120 mg / 100 ml of blood under, fasting conditions. When large quantities of glucose enter the blood stream, as it happens after a meal, the excess glucose is converted into insoluble glycogen and stored in liver and muscles for future use. Glycogen is reconverted into glucose and reintroduced into blood stream. All these processes are controlled by the hormone, Insulin, secreted by beta cells of Islets of Langerhans of Pancreas. As a result, sugar continues to get accumulated in the blood, till it is lost through urine. This leads to other complications and results in diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a state of expulsion of excess unused glucose in the urine due to less production of insulin.The word disease means, without ease or not at ease and it is opposite to health. The condition of malfunctioning of the organ system or ystems is called disease.
