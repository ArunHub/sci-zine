Agents of cross pollination
How is it possible for the transfer of pollen grains from one flower to another? In order to bring about cross pollination, it is necessary that the pollen should be carried from one flower to another of a different plant. This takes place through agency of animals, insects, wind and water. The transfer of pollen grains of a flower to the stigma of another flower of a different plant of the same species is called cross pollination or allogamy. The flowers pollinated by air are mostly small in size and without any attractive colour, smell and nectar. They produce a large number of pollen grains to make up for the wastage of pollen in times of transit.The pollen grains are dry and powdery, and hence are easily carried by the wind.Some pollen grains even have wings. Stigmas are large and protruding, even branched and feathery. e.g.Maize.
