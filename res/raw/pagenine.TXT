Central Nervous System
It is organized of two organs namely the brain and the spinal cord. The CNS is accommodated in the protective bony structures namely skull and vertebral column.
MENINGES:  The central nervous system is covered by three protective coverings or envelopes collectively called meninges. The outermost cover lying below the skull and vertebral column is doubly thick and is called Duramater. The middle covering is thin and vascularised and is called 
Arachnoid membrane. The innermost cover is a very thin delicate membrane and is closely applied on the outer surface of brain and spinal cord and it is called Piamater.
The human brain as in the case of other vertebrates, is divided into three  major parts:
a)  Fore brain  b) Mid brain c) Hind brain
