Heterotrophic nutrition
Fungal cells do not contain chloroplasts and they formed into saprophytes and parasites. Likewise all organisms, except the green plants do not possess  chloroplasts as they do not carry out  photosynthesis. They depend upon plants or other organisms for their nutrition.
Parasites
Some organisms live on other organisms for nourishment. They are called Parasites. The plants or animals in which the parasites live for nourishment are called hosts. Parasitic plants have some special roots, which penetrate the host plants and absorb food from the phloem, water and 
minerals from xylem. These roots are called haustoria. Some plants obtain nutrients from non-living organic matter. They are called saprophytes.
